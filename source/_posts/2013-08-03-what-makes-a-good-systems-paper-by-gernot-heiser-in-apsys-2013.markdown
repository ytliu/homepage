There's a session in APSys 2013, where Professor Gernot Heiser discussed about how to write a good system paper. It is really helpful, and I would like to share some of his suggestions here.

He introduced 4 rules of writing:

> reviewers are pot luck

Most problems raised by reviewers may be: 
	
	I'm not convinced you're solving a real problem
	I'm not convinced you're solving the problem
	I don't understand - too badly writing

And one important thing we need to know is:
	
	papers without a PC "champion" have a hard stand

Hence we must make sure there's something which at least one reviewer will think cool!

<!-- more -->

> a paper has a story

That means each paper should have **one** main message, and the author must know clearly what the message is, to make sure that the reader gets it, and make sure it's an interesting one.

A paper has a narrative. It starts from zero and then works on transmitting the message. Everything you write must support the message.

The other important notes you should know are: **maintain user state!** ( be conscious of what the reader knows/remembers)

> imited real estate: the two "c" s

#### be "clear"

Which means every sentence, paragraph, section should has a clear purpose, which should be clearly communicated, and the overall message is consistent.

#### be "concise" (brief but complete)

Don't waffle! Be precise! and make sure it's readable, lucid, enjoyable.

Other things need to consider are:

	maintain reader state
	define before use
	be aware of what the reader has learned
	recall/remind if necessary

> presentation matters - paper engineering

Some important bits here:

	introduction: sell the idea, the significance and the approach
	build tension, make reader interested
	convincing argumentation
	top-down, not bottom-up
	maintain reader state
	convincing evaluation
	state assumption/limitations honestly

And notes about each section of one paper:

### Introduction: most important part of the paper!

It mostly **issues** an idea to come, *explains* the problem you're solving, *outlines* your approach, *indicates* results/outcomes, *states* contributions, and *correctly cites PCs' work* important!!!

Meanwhile, you should capture the reader's interest to sell your idea, and be concise (stay within about one page), make sure the paper delivers what you promise. Remember: reviewer hate "bate and switch"

other parts:

### background: set the scene in more detail
     
In backgound, you can cite related work, describe problem in detail, explain solution in detail (**honest with limitations and assumptions**)

### abstract

it mostly used to steer to the right reviewers

	what, why, achievement, implication (four sentences)
	important: redo for camera ready

One interesting statement is that *abstract* usually has two purposes:

	for published: rewrite for people to read
	for reviewers: to select paper to review, get right reviewers!

### evaluation: often largest part

It shows your solution actually works

	progressive: significant improvements in important situations
	conservation: no (or insignificant) degradation elsewhere

Be careful about the scenarios of your benchmark
	
	artificial/constructed best cases will be discounted
	think of ways in which your approach could fail/deteriorate
	go out of your way to be fair, anticipate any scepticism of your work

------

Other notes:

## style and form

Write in engaging style, lead reader though the paper

	avoid tobbom-up structure, present idea top-down
	follow style rules
	use active voice
	avoid buzzwords("novel", "mobile social supercomputing in cloud")     

Be mindful of reader's brain state (which is lossy)

	maintain reader state
	don't assume every reviewer is expert in your narrow area
	but don't think you can hide stuff from reviewers

Follow formatting rules

	don't play with margin, baseline skip etc.
	don't use microscopic fonts > 40y olds have problems with <8pt font

Spell-check, proof-read, proof-read

	get native speaker to proof-read if you aren't
	get outsider to read it - great way to spot holes before it's too late!

Mechanics

	use revision control
	don't use MS word
	use BitTex

The trip to Singapore for APSys 2013 really make me harvest a large. It is my first time to submit a poster, and the first time to apply for the Travel Grant. And I've meet, talked to and discussed with a lot of genius and excellent people there. Although I'm not good at social, attending such excellent meeting let you learn from others a lot, and make you much more familiar with the System community.

Finally is my photo in presenting my poster work - RemoteBinder. The audience is the lengendary people Yandong Mao, graduated from Fudan University, and now PhD of MIT CSAIL.
